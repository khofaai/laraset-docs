# Introduction

Before starting to use `laraset` you need to have basic knowledge in [`laravel`](https://laravel.com) and at least [`vuejs`](https://vuejs.org).

## Why Laraset

After using `Laravel` you will for sure hear of `vuejs` and try it. and of course you will **LOVE IT**.
like me, i've start using `vuejs` and `laravel` in multiple project. **BUT** in most of project i was copy/past a lot of code specialy `components` trying not to forget any dependency and so on.
Then `Laraset` idea comes to me :<br>

>Why not a system when you can set Vuejs Components And Laravel Controller and Both routes with Database Migration in the same folder that present a specific Logic or Package ?!

Then name **`Laraset`** comes from **`Lara`**~~vel~~ and ~~pre~~**`set`**, for meaning that this System/Package is for all `Laravel` presets like `vuejs`, `reactjs`, `tailwindcss`, `bootstrap`.
:::tip Support
For the current version we support only `vuejs`

## I'm Not Convinced !!

Yeah you can't just start using some package from nobody. you need to tested and find the right cause / needs to use it and fulfill what you are lacking.
I will list some of `Laraset` feature that i believe are the most needed :
- **usability** : laravel is the most popular framework out there and `laraset` use full extension of it
- **modularity** : `laraset` use `unit` as a module that contain all your logic
- **export/import** : you can import export `unit` after all they use the same structure and logic
- **one page applications** : you can use modular system and one page application using both `laravel` and `vuejs`(_example_) in the same `unit`
